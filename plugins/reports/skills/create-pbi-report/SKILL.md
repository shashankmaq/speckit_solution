# Creating Power BI Reports

Create and scaffold Power BI reports using `pbir` CLI. Install with `uv tool install pbir-cli` or `pip install pbir-cli`. Load the `pbir-cli` and `pbi-report-design` skills alongside this one.

## Vague or Underspecified Prompts

When the user's request lacks specific measures, audience context, structural preferences, or formatting direction (e.g., "make me a dashboard", "create something with KPIs"), consult **`references/vague-prompts.md`** before proceeding. Close the gap between intent and specification with targeted questions; then apply sensible defaults (sqlbi theme, executive dashboard pattern, model-driven KPI selection) for anything the user can't or won't specify.

## Rules

- Visuals must not overlap one another
- Favor theme changes over visual overrides for static formatting
- Favor extension measures with theme colors (like "bad") for conditional formatting
- Always create reports inside a named project folder (e.g., `sales-dashboard/Sales.Report`)
- Run `pbir validate` after every mutation
- New reports already include the **sqlbi** theme -- do NOT run `pbir theme apply-template` unless the user explicitly asks for a different theme
- New reports already include a default **Page 1** with a **textbox** visual for the page title at position (20,20) with height 90 -- do NOT add a new textbox; rename the existing page with `pbir pages rename` instead. **Place all visuals at y:120 or below** to avoid overlapping the title textbox.

## Quick Reference

1. Get the workspace and semantic model from the user. If the user wants to connect to Power BI Desktop or create a report with source data, explain that a published semantic model in Fabric or Power BI is required first.
2. Analyze the user's requirements. Consider missing information -- charts, filters, formatting, analyses. Use `AskUserQuestion` if something is unclear.
3. Consider missing semantic model objects -- not just what the user asks for, but targets (1 year prior), baselines (avg for period), or trend aggregations (14-day rolling) that enrich visuals.
4. Create a project folder and report (default format is PBIP):

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /path/to/report-name
    cd /path/to/report-name
    pbir new report "Name.Report" -c "Workspace/Model.SemanticModel"
    ```

5. Rename the default page (do NOT add a new page unless the report needs multiple pages): `pbir pages rename "Name.Report/Page 1.Page" "Overview"`
6. Only if the user requests a custom theme: `pbir theme apply-template "Name.Report" template-name` (the sqlbi theme is already included by default)
7. Discover model fields: `pbir model "Name.Report" -d`
8. Query field values for filters or formatting: `pbir model "Name.Report" -q "EVALUATE VALUES('Table'[Column])"`
9. Inspect field data types: `pbir model "Name.Report" -d -t Table`
10. Add visuals (the page already has a textbox for the title): `pbir add visual kpi "Name.Report/Overview.Page" --title "Revenue"`
11. Validate: `pbir validate "Name.Report"`
12. Publish: `pbir publish "Name.Report" "Workspace.Workspace/Name.Report"`
13. Open in Fabric after publish: `pbir publish "Name.Report" "Workspace.Workspace/Name.Report" -o`
14. Or open locally in Power BI Desktop: `pbir open "Name.Report"`

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Understand the Business Process

Before creating visuals, explore the semantic model to understand the domain. Use `pbir model "Report.Report" -d` to inspect tables, columns, measures, and hierarchies. Consider:

- What domain does this model cover? (sales, finance, operations, logistics, etc.)
- What KPIs and measures matter most?
- What dimensions and hierarchies exist for slicing data?
- What time granularity makes sense? (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)

Present a concrete proposal via `AskUserQuestion` before building anything. The proposal should include:

- Which KPI cards to show and what measures they display
- What trend chart(s) to include and at what time granularity
- Which categorical breakdowns are most insightful
- What detail table/matrix to provide and with what hierarchies
- How filters should scope the data

Iterate on the design before executing -- revising a plan is cheaper than rebuilding visuals.

### Step 2: Identify Location and Connection

Determine where to create the report and what model it connects to. Use `AskUserQuestion` to understand the report's purpose, audience, and what decisions it should support.

```bash
pbir model                                       # List all known reports/models
pbir connect MyWorkspace MyReport                # Set active connection
```

If the user provides a workspace location, create the report locally in a project folder, then publish.

### Step 3: Create the Report

Create a project folder first, then the report inside it. Default format is PBIP.

```bash
mkdir -p sales-dashboard && cd sales-dashboard
pbir new report "Sales.Report" -c "MyWorkspace/Sales.SemanticModel"
```

The resulting structure:

```
sales-dashboard/
  Sales.Report/
    definition/
      pages/
      report.json
    StaticResources/
    definition.pbir
  Sales.pbip
```

### Step 4: Rename Default Page and Add More Pages

The report comes with a default "Page 1" that already has a textbox for the page title. Rename it rather than creating a new page. Only add additional pages if needed.

```bash
pbir pages rename "Sales.Report/Page 1.Page" "Overview"          # Rename default page
pbir add page "Sales.Report/Detail.Page" -n "Detail"              # Add extra pages only if needed
pbir pages active-page "Sales.Report" "Overview"
```

### Step 5: Configure Theme (only if user requests)

The sqlbi theme is already included by default. Only modify the theme if the user explicitly asks for a different theme or custom colors.

```bash
# Only if user wants a different theme:
pbir theme apply-template "Sales.Report" custom-theme

# Or to customize specific colors:
pbir theme set-colors "Sales.Report" --good "#00B050" --bad "#FF0000"
pbir theme set-text-classes "Sales.Report" title --font-size 16
pbir theme set-formatting "Sales.Report" "card.*.border.radius" --value 8
```

### Step 6: Add Visuals to Pages

Check actual page dimensions first -- do not assume 1280x720. Use `pbir pages json "Report.Report/Page.Page"` to verify. The object model validates that visuals fit within page bounds.

Fill the canvas with a purposeful visual hierarchy. Standard composition for a 1280x720 page:

- **Row 1 (y: 20-160): KPI visuals** -- 2-3 `kpi` visuals showing headline metrics with targets and trend lines
- **Row 2 (y: 180-460): Trend + Breakdown** -- Line/area chart (~60% width) + bar/column chart (~40% width)
- **Row 3 (y: 480-700): Detail table/matrix** -- Full-width `tableEx` or `matrix` with hierarchies and conditional formatting

For a complete layout example with exact coordinates, spacing verification, and visual commands, consult **`references/layout-example.md`**.

Key principles:

- **Consistent spacing**: Calculate positions from `(margin, gap, page_width, page_height)`. For 1280x720 with margin=24, gap=16, usable width = 1232. Verify arithmetic before placing visuals.
- **No redundant titles**: Page title = subject ("Order Lines"), visual titles = differentiator ("by Key Account", "Monthly Trend"). Hide subtitles: `pbir visuals subtitle "path" --no-show`
- **Sorting**: Charts auto-sort descending by first measure. After `pbir visuals bind`, set sort explicitly: `pbir visuals sort "path" -f "Table.Measure" -d Descending`

### Step 7: Add Filters

```bash
pbir add filter Date Year -r "Sales.Report" --values 2025
pbir add filter Geography Region -r "Sales.Report"
pbir add filter Products Category -p "Sales.Report/Detail.Page"
```

### Step 8: Format Visuals

Most formatting should come from the theme (Step 5). Apply bespoke formatting only for genuinely one-off cases.

```bash
# Bulk formatting via glob (requires -f for glob patterns)
pbir set "Sales.Report/**/*.Visual.title.show" --value true -f
pbir set "Sales.Report/**/*.Visual.border.show" --value true -f

# Individual visual formatting
pbir visuals title "Sales.Report/Overview.Page/Revenue.Visual" --fontSize 14 --bold
pbir visuals background "Sales.Report/Overview.Page/Revenue.Visual" --color "#F8F9FA"
```

### Step 9: Validate

```bash
pbir validate "Sales.Report"
pbir tree "Sales.Report" -v
```

### Step 10: Publish or Open

```bash
pbir publish "Sales.Report" "MyWorkspace.Workspace/Sales.Report"      # Publish
pbir publish "Sales.Report" "MyWorkspace.Workspace/Sales.Report" -o   # Publish and open in browser
pbir open "Sales.Report"                                               # Open in Power BI Desktop
```

## Common Report Patterns

### Executive Dashboard

- 2-3 KPI cards at top (revenue, orders, margin)
- 1 trend line/area chart (monthly if yearly filter, daily/weekly if monthly)
- 1-2 breakdown charts (bar/column) by key categories
- 1 detail table or matrix with hierarchies and conditional formatting
- Page size: 1280x720 (16:9)

### Detailed Analysis

- Slicer bar at top (date range, category filters)
- Large table or matrix as main content with conditional formatting
- Supporting KPI cards for context
- Page size: 1280x720 or 1920x1080

### Tooltip Pages

- Small page (320x240 or similar)
- 2-3 focused visuals
- Set via `pbir pages type "path" --type tooltip`
